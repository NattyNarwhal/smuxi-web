 * [Quick replies][771]: You can now query people by clicking on their nickname.
 * [Join bar follows the current network][780], ctrl+x switches the network
 * The /exec command is now supported, so now you can execute commands right
   from Smuxi. ([/exec -c][276], [/exec -o][277])
 * Size matters: The entry grows and shrinks automatically or [manually][831], and the
   topic bar changes size too. Say goodbye to pointless scrollbars! (Oliver Schneider)
 * Little things: New tab completion cycling (Ondřej Hošek), reconnect menu
   entry in a server tab context menu, [search from the person list][567],
   better support for Emacs key binds in GTK+ (Carlos), better Messaging Menu
   support for newer Ubuntu versions. No more hanging gnome-shell for a few
   seconds when a notification is shown.
 * The Windows and Mac OS X package now ship an Faenza icon theme by default.

### Mac OS X Enhancements ###

Massive OS X improvements were brought into this release.

 * IRC URL handler: Clicking on irc:// links can bring up Smuxi.
 * Behaviour: Smuxi has Macintosh menus (including global menu) and behaviour.
 * Shortcuts: Smuxi has fully functional keyboard shortcuts on Mac.
 * Font: Uses Menlo and fallbacks to Monaco font by default.

Inspired by changes described [here][https://live.gnome.org/Smuxi/Porting/Mac].
Kudos to Jonathan Pryor and Michael Lutonsky for OS X guidance and testing!

[smuxi-server launch script][828] is now included in the Mac package.

### Text Frontend Enhancements ###

 * Color: The navigation bar displays color for windows just like the GNOME
   frontend does.
 * The Basics: Nickname completion, window closing, config management through a
   new /config command, and better Xterm detection support are all in here.
 * More stable

### Campfire Support (Beta) ###

IRC, Twitter and XMPP wasn't sufficient to Carlos Martín Nieto thus he added
Campfire, a completely new protocol to Smuxi.

The Campfire engine supports:

 * Automatically opens active rooms on connect
 * List and search of available rooms using the Find Group Chat dialog
 * /join command: opens rooms
 * /topic command: changes topic of a room
 * /upload command: retrieves uploads

### XMPP Support ###

There are massive XMPP enhancements. Thanks to Oliver Schneider (ker), we now
have:

 * Contact list
 * /contact command
 * /roster command
 * Configurable priorities (away and available) with /priority command
 * Highlight support (Mirco Bauer)

   battery power.

 * German (Bianca Mix)
 * Chinese Simp (Dean Lee)
 * Danish (Joe Hansen)

   as soon as they get pushed.
 * Better Visual Studio support: msbuild-preprocess.ps1 (Will Johansson)
 * Fixed configure failure on Slackware/Frugalware

### Behind the Scenes ###
