[[!meta title="Smuxi 0.8.9 Release"]]
[[!meta date="2012-01-01"]]

Just in time for 2012 I am very pleased to announce Smuxi **0.8.9** codenamed
**"One Giant Leap"**. During the development [56 bug reports][bugs] and
[33 feature requests][features] in [593 commits][commits] were worked on making
this release a major milestone of the Smuxi project.

Here are the highlights of this release:

### Development Builds / Rolling Releases ###
After the 0.8 release it became clear that a continious and short
development -> test cycle is important to keep the project going
quickly. At some point I have received requests if the project is dead while
it was more active than ever. The lack of new releases (for about 15 months)
lead to this wrong impression. Thus Smuxi can be obtained from
[development builds] now. This includes [daily builds][#504] for
Debian (Squeeze, Wheezy, Sid),
Ubuntu (Lucid, Maverick, Natty, Oneiric, Precise) and Windows.

We invite everyone to use these daily builds to keep track of the latest
development of Smuxi. Issues and regressions are fixed in a very short period
(usually the same day).

### Mac OS X support ###
With the help of Steven McGrath (Steve\[cug\]) who created the initial Mac OS X
installer for Smuxi we now have official support for Mac OS X. The download
page contains the instructions how to obtain and install Smuxi on Mac OS X.
This makes the 4th platform where Smuxi can be used on besides Windows, Linux
and *BSD.

For now Smuxi 0.8.9 doesn't feel as native as it could as it relies on the GTK+
port. We are looking into [enhancing the experience][osx-port] though, just
stay tuned.

### Persistent Message Buffers (Beta) ###

### Jabber / XMPP Support (Beta) ###

### Text Interface (Alpha) ###
This is the first release that contains a text frontend based on the
[STFL library][STFL]. STFL is a library that uses ncurses to draw text based
user interface using a markup language (like Glade for GTK+). This frontend
is in early alpha state and lacks a lot of interface features and likes to
crash. It is still included to attract potential developers who want to enhance
this frontend. The frontend can be enabled by passing --enable-frontend-stfl
to the configure script and then by executing smuxi-frontend-stfl.

### NetworkManager Support ###
[#205]

### IPv6 Support ###
You can now connect to IRC servers using the [IPv6 protocol][#22]

## Smuxi Server specific highlights ###

### More interactive and much faster synchronization ###
When connecting to a smuxi-server you had to wait till Smuxi finished the
synchronization before you could the interface. Also you could not tell how far
the synchronization was and just had to wait till it was completed.
With Smuxi 0.8.9 the connect just takes a few seconds and all chats are
synchronized in the background with [a progress bar][#624] so you can use the interface
from the first moment on and know how far it is. The speed how much it takes to
synchronize all chats also reduced drastictly by 400%!

### More background communication ###
When using a smuxi-server the interface sometimes had load times like when
[opening the preferences][#597] or when using the [nickname completion][#616]
(using the tab key). These operations are done in the background and no longer blocks the
interface. Also when the communication is lost to the smuxi-server the frontend
will now automatically reconnect to it in the background.

### Low Bandwidth Mode ###
[#591]

### Stable Protocol ###
[#600]

### Shutdown Command ###
[#647]

### Built-in SSH Keyfile Support ###


### Enhanced Find Group Chat Support ###
[#655]
[#548]

### Enhanced Windows Experience ###
GTK# 2.19.10 on Windows support [#619]
Consolas font [#216]
Deals with multiple GTK+ installs [#551]

### SSL for IRC fixed ###
IRC with SSL was only working with the default port of 6697. Now any port can
be used with SSL.

### Crash Related Issues ###
[Desktop notifications][#512] could [crash Smuxi][#574] [in case][#630] [of errors][#533] related to the
notification system or an [absent notification daemon][#507]. 
crash dialog [#638]
ctrl+w [#518]
/window close on Smuxi tab crash [#523]
Find Group Chat on Smuxi tab crash [#532]
[Number-only network names crashed Smuxi on startup][#573]
[/network switch freenode crash][#610]
[GTK+ without SVG support lead to a crash][#304]
All these crash issues no longer happen.

### Enhanced Notice Handling ###
[#38]
[#494]
ChanServ and NickServ notices [#554]

### Twitter fixes ###
Twitter made some changes to their API which broke the Twitter support of
Smuxi 0.8. This was taken care of and also [a][#623] [few][#644] [other][#464] [issues][#649] were solved
allowing Smuxi 0.8.9 to work smoothly with Twitter again.

### Extended Keybindings ###
ctrl+tab [#659]
ctrl+n [#505]
Keybindings still work even with a [hidden menu bar][#462]
