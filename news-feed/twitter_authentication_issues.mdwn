[[!meta title="Twitter Authentication Issues"]]

Shortly after the release of 0.8.9 Smuxi users reported issues with Twitter.
Connecting to Twitter, OAuth login and loading the timelines worked fine but
suddenly after letting it run for a while an error like this occurred:
"An error occurred while fetching the replies from Twitter. Reason: Could not authenticate you."
There is nothing that Smuxi can really fix, if Twitter temporarily replies:
"sorry, your authentication is wrong", Smuxi has to believe it and stops making
further timeline updates. When this happens you can get the timelines back by
closing the Twitter tab and reconnect it. The good news is, it seems like this
issue is now solved on Twitters side and it works as usual again.
