## Hook State ##

Hooks are executed when the event occurs and have to exit so further processing
can be done. If hooks need to retain state they can write their state to files
of the current directory ($PWD). Each hook has its own state directory and can
be found in $HOME/.local/share/smuxi/hook-state/$HOOK\_PATH. The hook does
*not* need to change to or create the state directory, as the hook runner will
do this for the hook, guaranteed.

## Hook Points ##

### engine/protocol-manager/on-connected ###

### engine/protocol-manager/on-disconnected ###

### engine/protocol-manager/on-message-sent ###

### engine/protocol-manager/on-message-received ###

### frontend/command-manager/command-$cmd ###

## Hook Commands ##

### Session.Command $cmd $cmd_params... ###

Supported session commands can be found [here][session commands].

Example:

    echo "Session.Command /echo I am a hook!"

### ProtocolManager.Command $cmd $cmd\_params... ####

Supported protocol manager commands fully depends on the protocol manager
implementation/type, thus you need to check the PROTOCOL_MANAGER_PROTOCOL
environment variable first! Here you can find a list for [IRC][irc commands],
[Twitter][twitter commands], [XMPP][xmpp commands], [JabbR][jabbr commands] and
[Campfire][campfire commands].

Example:

    if [ "$SMUXI_PROTOCOL_MANAGER_PROTOCOL" = "IRC" ]; then
        echo "ProtocolManager.Command /topic This is the new topic"
    fi
