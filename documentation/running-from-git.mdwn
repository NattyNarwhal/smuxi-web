If you like living on the bleeding edge and can't wait for the latest features,
then you can build and run Smuxi from the git source repository.

On Debian and Ubuntu it should be as simple as running the following commands:

	sudo apt-get build-dep smuxi
	sudo apt-get install git
	git clone git://git.qnetp.net/smuxi.git
	cd smuxi
	./autogen.sh
	make run

On Windows it is even simpler and you just need to install a development
snapshot which you can find [[here|http://app.cresces.com/smuxi/]].
