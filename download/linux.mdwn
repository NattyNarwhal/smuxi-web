**Download: [smuxi-0.8-1-bin.tar.gz][]**

This package contains pre-compiled Smuxi binaries plus the required
libraries (log4net, Nini, SmartIrc4net), suitable for Linux (using Mono)
users.

Linux users using the binary tarball have to make sure the required
runtime and libraries are installed in order to run Smuxi correctly!

You need the Mono runtime (\>= 1.2.6) and the GTK\# libraries (\>= 2.8)
which you can [download here][Mono download].

Alternatively you can install Mono and GTK\# from your package
repository of your Linux Distribution, just make sure they are the right
version!

After you have installed those you can run the smuxi-frontend-gnome
script from the binary tarball or run the following from a terminal:

    mono smuxi-frontend-gnome.exe
