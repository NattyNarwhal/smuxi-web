question="How do I start Smuxi with another language?"
answer="""
Smuxi uses per default your OS language if it is available for Smuxi.

If you want to start Smuxi with another language, please have a look at
[Transifex] whether the language you would like to have is already available.

On Linux/\*BSD this would start Smuxi in English:

    LANG=C smuxi-frontend-gnome

If you would like to use another language you could start Smuxi like this:

    LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8 smuxi-frontend-gnome

Replace the _fr\_FR.UTF-8_ part with the appropriate one for your language.

Why is Smuxi still not starting in the selected language?

1. Make sure you have installed the respective locale
2. Make sure your system is not overriding the selection
