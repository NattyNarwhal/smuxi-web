question="Browse Mode, what is special about it?"
answer="""
Imagine you want to have a look into another tab without the markerline to move.
Or you want to scroll through the tabs without the tab status to change (remove
highlight text color). 
The _Browse Mode_ allows you to check tabs without interrupting any of the
activity features. This way you will no longer tamper with your highlights.

This features is included in version 0.8.0 and greater
